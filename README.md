- 👋 Hi, I’m @alyssadpham and I'm very new to GitHub platform!
- 👀 I am a recent graduate with major in Biological Sciences, minor in Mathematics (pure or applied, depending on how useful the knowledge is to my major.)
- 🌱 I’m proficient in MATLAB and R (along with documenting language Latex), currently learning Python, probably Java and C++ if my career ever needs them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate, or just to learn more about all kinds of Python projects, from easy to difficult.
- 📫 Please feel free to reach me via Discord (blueberria) or email (alyssadpham@gmail.com).
